                    <p class="textcolor"> My name is Deana Baker and I am a single mother to the sassiest three year old on the planet. I have
                        spent the last few years of my life working as an independent contractor/brand ambassador for a ton
                        of companies and also have bartended on the side.
                        <br>
                        <br>Originally, I wanted to be a nurse and took up two years of community college doing general coursework
                        before I realized it wasnt what I wanted to do. I am now ready to embark on my career as a software
                        engineer, as I have finally found something that I love. I am currently a student through the University
                        of Arizona at the coding bootcamp. Upon graduation in October of 2018, I plan to finish my associates
                        degree in computer science since my general college coursework is already completed.
                        <br>
                        <p class="tab textcolor"> My hobbies include hiking, reading, writing, Grey's Anatomy or Harry Potter marathons, yoga, cross-training
                            at the gym and now more recently, coding and thinking of new ideas for future apps I can build
                            to help people or solve a problem.
